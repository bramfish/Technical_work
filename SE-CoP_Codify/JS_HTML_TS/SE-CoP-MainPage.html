            <h2>Domain Driven Design</h2>
            <p>
                Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development that values simplicity and focuses on the core domain of the problem at hand. It involves breaking down complex business problems into smaller, more manageable parts, and then building software solutions that address those parts in a cohesive and effective way.

        <!-- Clean Coding Approach -->
        <div style="width: 30%;">
            <h2>Clean Coding Approach</h2>
            <p>
                Clean coding is a software development approach that emphasizes writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It involves using clear and concise naming conventions, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and following established coding standards and best practices.

        <!-- CQRS Pattern -->
        <div style="width: 30%;">
            <h2>CQRS Pattern</h2>
            <p>
                Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a software design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into separate components. This allows for greater scalability, as read and write operations can be optimized independently, and also enables more flexible and efficient data storage and retrieval.
